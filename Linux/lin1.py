1)pwd - current directory

2)rmdir: To delete a directory, use rmdir. However, rmdir can only be used to remove an
empty directory. To remove files and directories, use rm -rf directoryname/ (where
–rf will recursively remove all the files and directories from inside the directory)

3)touch: The command’s initial intent was to set the file modification date to the current time.
But since it will make a file if one doesn’t already exist, it’s frequently used to make empty files.
Here’s an example:
touch filename.txt

4)ls: Use the ls command to see all files and directories inside the directory you are in. If you
want to see hidden files, use the ls -a command. By using the ls -la command, you can
see all the files and directories as a list

5)cp: To copy files from the command line, use the cp command. This requires two arguments:
the first specifies the location of the file to be copied, and the second specifies where to copy
it. It could be a new folder or a new file (in case you need a copy of it)

6)mv: You can use the mv command to move a file or directory from one location to another or
even to rename a file. For example, you can rename a file from file1.txt to file2.txt
by running the following command:
mv file1.txt file2.txt

7)rm: rm is used to remove files or directories,

8)locate: The locate command is useful when you forget the location of a file. Using the
-i argument helps to ignore case sensitivity. So, if you want to find a file named file1.txt,
run the locate -i file1.txt command. This is the equivalent of search in Windows.
